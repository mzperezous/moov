### Overwiew

_Moov is in its very early design stages._

Moov is a suite of data ingestion/query tools with three main components:

1. Automated migration from one data source to another.
2. A suite of ORM scaffolding tools based on existing data sources.
    1. ORM -> ORM porting tools to assist in porting applications across languages without connecting your data.
3. A simple interface to query data across one or multiple projects from a single application.
